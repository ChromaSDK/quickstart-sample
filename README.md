# Razer ChromaSDK - C++ Quickstart Sample
This is a minimal sample application to help you better understand the basics of how to integrate and interact with the Chroma SDK. The [Official Sample][Sample] provided by Razer can be somewhat overwhelming to new developers.


## Step-by-step Guide
The code itself is very minimalistic and is well commented. However, a wiki page will be created to guide you through the steps on recreating the provided quickstart sample from a blank template.
